		</p>
		
		<h3>Visual Editor - Theme</h3>

		<h4>What does the Color Scheme option do?</h4>
		<p>Every well designed website has a color palette which defines the dominant colors of the site.  You can choose from a set of predefined palettes or even better, you can create your own! If you have an image file of your campaign logo you can use a palette generator. 
		</p>
		
		<p>These are some popular ones:<p>
		<p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pictaculous.com/">Pictaculous</a>
		</li><li><a href="http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/"> DeGraeve Color Palette</a>
		</li><li><a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/08/01/five_amazing_color_palette_generators#awesm=~oxu50yCQ8nkRZ9"> Five Amazing Color Palette Generators</a>

		<p>Or you can build your own palette:<br>
		<p><ul><li><a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer</a>
		</li></ul></p>

		<h4>What is the Background Image?</h4>
		<p>The Background Image creates the backdrop for your front page. Select from one of the many options to find a backdrop that fits your district, or you can upload an image to use. Crowd shots or a photograph taken during a site visit are great choices.
		</p>

		<h3>Visual Editor - Images</h3>

		<h4>What should I use for the Campaign Logo?</h4>
		<p>The campaign logo is the graphic your campaign uses to brand the candidate and therefor is an important part of branding your website.  Most campaigns will contract a graphic artist to design the logo.  They will often use a dark background color, with white (or light) text for the logo. We also recommend you use a .gif or .png with a transparent background. For best results, use an image that's 480px wide, and not too tall. The logo image will be placed in the upper right hand corner of the homepage.  Try out different sizes for your logo to find the one that fits best. If you do not specify a logo, that space will be filled with the Campaign Name specified in the Content section.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is the Splash Image?</h4>
		<p>The Splash Image is the image that will dominate the center of your homepage. Make sure that the image is not too tall so that it fits well, and does not make the page too long. For best results, use a .jpg that's 800px wide. Landscape-style shots only, no tall/thin images / portraits. Ideal for the space is actually a high-quality family photo or exciting campaign-trail shot like the candidate speaking at a rally.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is the Optional Caption for?</h4>
		<p>The Optional Caption is text that will overlay the Splash Image. The caption is a great place for a tagline for the candidate. Doesn’t use the Optional Caption if your Splash Image already has text in it. The caption will obscure the text, making both difficult to read.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Visual Editor - Content</h3>

		<h4>What is the Campaign Name?</h4>
		<p>The Campaign name has 2 pieces - the candidate’s name and the office she is running for.  It is used as a placeholder for the logo until your campaign has a logo image, and is also used at the footer of the page.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is the Why I’m Running text?</h4>
		<p>This is your candidate’s elevator pitch. It should follow the 27-9-3 rule. 27 words or less that can be repeated in about 9 seconds which conveys 3 main points about why the candidate is running. It is used as the appeal above the signup form.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How is the Candidate Biography used?</h4>
		<p>If a Candidate Biography is specified, then a new link will be added to the navigation to a new page of the site, the About Page.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is the Legal Disclaimer?</h4>
		<p>The Legal Disclaimer is the legal text required to be on most campaign materials.  If the office is federal, it should have the format “Paid for by” then the official name of the campaign that was used when filing with the FEC.  If is a state or lower office, the Secretary of State or Board of Elections may have their own disclosure rules requiring a similar text.
		</p>

	  	<h2 id="winn">Win Number Calculator</h2>
	  	
	  	<h4>What is the Win Number Calculator?</h4>
		<p>The Win Number Calculator is a tool that takes a few statistics about voting in your district and calculates your Win Number - the estimated number of votes you need to win. In a numbers-driven campaign, it's important to have a win number and to work towards it.  A lot of field organizers spend a ton of time working on numbers before they've recruited enough volunteers to hit one tenth of their goals. So this win number calculator is a way to save you time and get you a ballpark estimate.
		</p>

		</p>

		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I determine my Turnout History?</h4>
		<p>The Turnout History is publicly available data that is tracked by your state Board of Elections or your Secretary of State.  It is usually available online.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What if my district has not had 3 elections yet due to redistricting?</h4>
		<p>You have a couple of options. 
		<ol><li>You could include a single year’s data multiple times.  
		</li><li>If your district is similar enough to a previously existing district, then you can use the data from the old district. 
		</li><li>For a drastically changed district, you can break down the district by precinct, and add up the turn out for each, divided by the number of residents who voted. This is a few hours work, even if you're good with a spreadsheet. If you are the candidate, get someone to do this for you.
		</li></ol>
		</p>

		<h4>How do I determine the number of registered voters in your district?</h4>
		<p>The number of registered voters in your district is publicly available data that is tracked by your state Board of Elections or your Secretary of State.  It is usually available online at your Secretary of State, State Board of Elections, or Government Accountability Board website.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What do I use my Win Number for?</h4>
		<p>Your Win Number is what campaigners also refer to as 50% + 1, the number of votes you need for victory.  It is the basis for a numbers-based campaign and allows your to calculate all your field goals such as IDs, door knocks, contact made, and GOTV targeting.
		</p>
		<p>The Win Number is also great for motivating you and your team If you have 15,000 votes to win you can't run a campaign like a 3,000-vote candidates. If it's your plan to knock on every door in the district, having a win number helps you remember just how many doors you have to go.
