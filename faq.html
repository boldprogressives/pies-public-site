	  	<h2 id="winn">Win Number Calculator</h2>
	  	
	  	<h4>What is the Win Number Calculator?</h4>
		<p>The Win Number Calculator is a tool that takes a few statistics about voting in your district and calculates your Win Number - the estimated number of votes you need to win. In a numbers-driven campaign, it's important to have a win number and to work towards it.  A lot of field organizers spend a ton of time working on numbers before they've recruited enough volunteers to hit one tenth of their goals. So this win number calculator is a way to save you time and get you a ballpark estimate.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is Turnout History?</h4>
		<p>The Turnout History is the number of residents who voted in your district in past general elections.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is a Turnout Rate?</h4>
		<p>The Turnout Rate is the percentage of voters who are registered to vote at the time of the election that turned out and voted in a past election.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I determine my Turnout History?</h4>
		<p>The Turnout History is publicly available data that is tracked by your state Board of Elections or your Secretary of State.  It is usually available online.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What if my district has not had 3 elections yet due to redistricting?</h4>
		<p>You have a couple of options. 
		<ol><li>You could include a single year’s data multiple times.  
		</li><li>If your district is similar enough to a previously existing district, then you can use the data from the old district. 
		</li><li>For a drastically changed district, you can break down the district by precinct, and add up the turn out for each, divided by the number of residents who voted. This is a few hours work, even if you're good with a spreadsheet. If you are the candidate, get someone to do this for you.
		</li></ol>
		</p>

		<h4>How do I determine the number of registered voters in your district?</h4>
		<p>The number of registered voters in your district is publicly available data that is tracked by your state Board of Elections or your Secretary of State.  It is usually available online at your Secretary of State, State Board of Elections, or Government Accountability Board website.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What do I use my Win Number for?</h4>
		<p>Your Win Number is what campaigners also refer to as 50% + 1, the number of votes you need for victory.  It is the basis for a numbers-based campaign and allows your to calculate all your field goals such as IDs, door knocks, contact made, and GOTV targeting.
		</p>
		<p>The Win Number is also great for motivating you and your team If you have 15,000 votes to win you can't run a campaign like a 3,000-vote candidates. If it's your plan to knock on every door in the district, having a win number helps you remember just how many doors you have to go.

	  	<h2 id="call">Call Time Tracker</h2>
	  	
	  	<h3>Log Activity</h3>
	  	<h4>What does the Log Activity tab do?</h4>
		<p>The Log Activity tab is where you record each day’s call time results.
		</p>

		<h4>How do I add a new day’s call time result?</h4>
		<p>You can add a day’s result in the Add New Data section at the top of the Log Activity tab. To Save the data, click the Add button to the right. This is the data you need to specify:
		</p>
		<ul><li><b>Date</b> - the date that the calls were made
		</li><li><b>Calls</b> - the number of phone numbers dialed
		</li><li><b>Connects</b> - the number of calls that resulted in the desired person answering the phone, whether this was a full conversation with an ask included, or something less successful. Connect rates help you track whether you're calling at the right times of day and using good lists.
		</li><li><b>Collected via Phone</b> - the amount of money generated by your calls that was submitted via an online fundraising page that day
		</li><li><b>Hard Pledged</b> - the amount of money that has been firmly committed to during the call time. Only use this field when the ask was for a specific amount and the donor replied with a 'yes'. Soft pledges are not currently tracked in the call time tracker.
		</li><li><b>Hours Completed</b> - the total number of hours spent calling for the day
		</li><li><b>Hours Scheduled</b> - the total number of hours the candidate was initially scheduled to call that day

		<p>To edit the data for a day that has already been entered, go to the Past Activity table and click the Edit button on the end of the row with that day’s date. The data for that day will fill the fields of the Add New Data section, where you can change the values you wish to edit, and then click the Add button to save. Also, in the "Add New Data" section, if you select the day you want to edit, it will load up that day's data in the form and you can save it back with changes.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I delete a day’s data record?</h4>
		<p>To delete the data for a day that has already been entered, got to the Past Activity table and click the delete (garbage can) icon, then confirm you would like it removed.
		</p>
		
		<h4>When I click edit, nothing seems to happen.  What’s going on?</h4>
		<p>You likely clicked edit on an empty row.  When you click on edit, it fills the fields in the Add New Data section with that row.  If the row is empty, only the Date will get filled.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Help!  How can I export my data?</h4>
		<p>Don’t worry -- exporting your data is super simple.  Just highlight the rows you want in the Past Activity table, then copy and paste into a spreadsheet program of your choice.
		<p>
		
		<h3>Dashboard</h3>
		<h4>What are goals?</h4>
		<p>Goals are the amount of pledges you aspire to collect during call time for this week, this quarter, or over the life of your campaign.  Setting goals allows you to track your progress and determine what kind of changes you need to fine tune your fundraising efforts.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What happened to my goal from this past week or this past quarter?</h4>
		<p>Weekly and quarterly goals automatically get cleared when a new week or quarter starts.</p>

		<h4>What is the “pledged this week” goal?</h4>
		<p>This is the total of Hard Pledges and money Collected Online you expect to collect during call time this week.  A week runs from Monday through Sunday.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Why are my metrics 0?</h4>
		<p>If you have no data logged for the time period specified, This Week of This Quarter, then your metrics will be zero.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I get my call time totals for this week, this quarter, or for the life of the campaign?</h4>
		<p>Under the Detailed Progress section of the Dashboard tab, you can specify totals in the Progress For dropdown.  The table below will break out your call time metrics by the grouping you specify in the dropdown on the left.  The totals will appear at the bottom of the table in bold.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I get my call time totals for a specific week, quarter, or year?</h4>
		<p>Under the Detailed Progress section of the Dashboard tab, in the dropdown to the left of the Progress For dropdown you can select a particular time period you would like totaled at the bottom of the table in bold. The Send Reports tab is also great for getting totals.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Can I sort my results by Calls, Connects, etc.?</h4>
		<p>Yes! Just click on the column heading to sort.</p>

		<h3>Send Reports</h3>
		<h4>How do I generate a report of my call time progress?</h4>
		<p>On the Send Report tab, click the green button called Generate Report. The report will appear in the box below, where you can edit and copy into an email.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What are the different Report Types?</h4>
		<p>On the Send Reports tab, the Call Time Tracker offers Daily, Weekly, and Quarterly reports that can be selected by the Report Type dropdown.  By default, the report will default to the current date. To generate a report other than the current day, week, or quarter, specify the start date of the period in the Select Date field.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How do I send my report?</h4>
		<p>After clicking the Generate Report button, your report will be displayed in the section below.  You can use the Copy To Clipboard button to select all and copy the report, then paste into a document or email of your choice.
