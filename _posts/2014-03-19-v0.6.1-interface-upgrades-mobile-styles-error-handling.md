This release contains several minor interface enhancements, better mobile styling for the candidate website, and automated error reporting when publishing your website.

### General ###
* The campaign's name (e.g. "Monica Nuno for Congress") is now printed in the top nav. (#1736)

### Website Builder### 
* Automated error notifications are now sent to PIES Support whenever the "Publish" action fails for any unexpected reason. (#1814, #1815, #2050)
* Users are now notified whenever the "Publish" action fails for any unexpected reason, rather than a "please wait" notice remaining indefinitely. (#1814, #1815, #2050)
* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to add more than one Endorsement. (#2042)

### Candidate Website### 
* The mobile nav menu is now narrower, making it easier to close it. (#2029)
* The icon for the mobile nav is now visible on Android phones.  (#2038)
* The logo in the footer nav is now sized more consistently on mobile devices.  (#1980)
* The mobile nav menu now contains all available pages, not just the most important three. (#2031)
