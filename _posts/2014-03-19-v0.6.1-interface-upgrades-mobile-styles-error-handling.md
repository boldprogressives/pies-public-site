This release contains several minor interface enhancements, better mobile styling for the candidate website, and automated error reporting when publishing your website.

### General ###
* The campaign's name (e.g. "Monica Nuno for Congress") is now printed in the top nav. 

### Website Builder### 
* Automated error notifications are now sent to PIES Support whenever the "Publish" action fails for any unexpected reason.* Users are now notified whenever the "Publish" action fails for any unexpected reason, rather than a "please wait" notice remaining indefinitely. 
* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to add more than one Endorsement. 

### Candidate Website### 
* The mobile nav menu is now narrower, making it easier to close it. 
* The icon for the mobile nav is now visible on Android phones.  
* The logo in the footer nav is now sized more consistently on mobile devices.  
* The mobile nav menu now contains all available pages, not just the most important three.
