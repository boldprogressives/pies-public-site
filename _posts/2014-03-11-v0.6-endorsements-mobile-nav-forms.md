Several changes are out this week, mostly focusing on he Website Builder. The navbar menu for mobile devices has been upgraded to look and feel like a native mobile app. We also have an endorsements section, and easier access to your form signups. The full list of changes is below.

### Candidate Website### 
* A new "Endorsements" section has been added to the homepage, if the user configures one or more endorsements in the Website Builder. 
* Top navbar now always contains no more than four entries, which change depending on the features that the user has enabled.
* On mobile and tablet devices, the top navbar has been replaced with a "native mobile"-feeling sliding menu. 
* The size of the logo image now has more predictable behavior across screen sizes and never overruns into the navbar. 
* A small visual inconsistency in the top navbar has been fixed, which was only present if the "DONATE" link was unset. 

### Website Builder### 
* A new "Form Signups" page has been added, allowing the user to see tallies per form and to download data as a spreadsheet. 
* Self-hosted websites are no longer supported. 
* The default view is now Laptop, instead of Desktop. 
* The dropdown navigation menu is now working again. 

### Platform### 
* Some CSS and font assets have been reorganized and are now hosted on our servers instead of at a third-party CDN. 

### Call Time Tracker### 
* The Angular.js dependency has been upgraded to a more recent version.
