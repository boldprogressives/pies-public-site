Version 0.8 of PIES contains a new application: The Field Tracker. The Field Tracker is designed to help you keep track of key metrics for volunteer activity and voter contact efforts for your campaign. 

For the last three election cycles, PCCC Campaign Experts have been helping campaigns set up tracking spreadsheets to track their progress toward ever-increasing field goals. Now, just like the Call Time Tracker helps track fundraising, the Field Tracker is there to help you stay on pace, running a metrics-driven campaign from day one through GOTV.

It includes the following new features and bugfixes:

### Field Tracker ###
* There is now a Field Tracker application.

### Candidate Website ###
* Users can now enable a rotating image carousel for multiple splash images on their homepage, by clicking "Add new image" in the Images > Splash Images section of the Website Builder sidebar.  
* Restored missing icons.  
* Site fonts are now loaded correctly.  
* Cleaner mobile footer: no navbar and no logo.  
* Adjusted font sizes and widths for text-based candidate "logos".  

### Website Builder ###
* The "phone number" field is now correctly labelled once more.  
* Added width constraints on preview window for widescreen preview mode 
* Inputs are no longer obscured by their labels.
