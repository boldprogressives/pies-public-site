We have a few bugfixes and minor changes. Most importantly, Sentry, our error-tracking system, sends more helpful reports to help us more quickly diagnose any problems we might uncover when our first users start doing things we didn't expect. 

### Candidate Website### 
* After-action "Thanks" page no longer shows end user's IP address. (#1585)

### Website Builder### 
* On the "Domains" page, the content in the well now has a lighter font weight. (#1658)

### Social Linker### 
* When the Social Linker tells a user that she needs to set up Bitly, she will be redirected back to the Social Linker after successful Bitly setup. When setting up Bitly without being prompted by the Social Linker, she will not be redirected to the Social Linker when setup is complete. (#1481)

### Platform### 
* Our server error tracking system, Sentry, now tracks the campaign and username associated with each error, so that we can more easily debug problems and reach out to users when we see that they experienced a server error. (#1813)
* The submit button on the footer's help form no longer jiggles around when you hover over it. (#1367)
* Our SVG files are now much smaller, which will reduce page load times a bit. (#1429)
