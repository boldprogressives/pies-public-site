This week we have a bunch of new features and bugfixes, including a couple that were widely requested by our first class of beta users: SEO enhancements and Favicon selection. Every page on the candidate website now has unique and descriptive titles, and your site contains a `sitemap.xml` file that helps search engines index your site. 

**Note: To take advantage of the new SEO features, you will need to log in to the [Webiste Builder](https://pies.pccc.co/app/website/#home) and republish your site.**

We had a few people ask about the favicon, so we made it editable just like the background images. Choose from a few preset favicons, or upload your own! Finally, there are a bunch of bugfixes and code cleanup in this week's release, which should give you an easier time using the tools, and make it easier for us to keep rolling out new features in future weeks. 

Here's the full list:

### Candidate Website ### 
* Users can now choose from several favicons or upload their own

* If form validation fails, browser will now scroll to the problematic input 
* News entries now appear in reverse order from their position in the website builder, so that more recently added articles will appear at the top of the page
