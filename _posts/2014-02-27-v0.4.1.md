The following changes have been deployed.

### General Platform### 
* Reduce flashes of unstyled content when a user visits a page for the first time, by loading stylesheets and javascripts earlier in the HTML document (#1703)

### Candidate Website### 
* The footer layout is now cleaner, with the candidate's logo now having the same size as the header logo instead of being much larger, and the legal disclaimer box is now aligned to the bottom of the logo image (#1959)
* Users can override the default "Donate" text of their donation buttons, e.g. to read "Contribute" or "Give Now" instead (#1971)
* Homepage "sign up to volunteer" link no longer has an erroneous extra slash which was causing navigation errors in some browsers (#1952)

### Website Builder### 
* The campaign name will now be sent when users submit help requests from the Website Builder screen; previously the campaign name was inadvertently omitted from help requests on this page (#1939)
* Manually navigating to a preview of a nonexistent page now returns a 404 response instead of a 500 Server Error being shown to the user and logged in our Sentry error-tracking environment (#1917)

### Call Time Tracker### 
* Variable names have been cleaned up to match our Javascript style guide; this does not result in any user visible changes (#1801)
