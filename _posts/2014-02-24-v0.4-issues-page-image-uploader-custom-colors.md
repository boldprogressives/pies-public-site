title: "v0.4: 'Issues' Page, Image Uploader, Custom Colors"

We have a great set of updates for you this Monday morning! The Website Builder now has a panel to add Issues, which will add an Issues page to your website the next time you deploy it. Take a look! The image uploader is now more consistent across browsers, and displays a "progress bar" to show your upload progress. (It's much nicer.) By popular demand, you can now create your own color palette! Use it wisely.

**Note: To take advantage of these changes, you will need to log in to the Website Builder and republish your site.**

The complete list of released changes is below.

### Candidate Website### 
* Users can now add an "Issues" page through the website builder 
* Users can now choose a custom color palette in the website builder 
* The topnav and footernav now contain a "Home" link to make navigation easier 
* Fixed the font color of the "Volunteer" page subheading to match the website's palette 

### Website Builder### 
* Image upload widgets now display an animated progress bar and loading indicator to cue the user of ongoing progress when uploading large files 
* Rearchitected "Preview" mode approach to work more robustly and consistently across browsers and regardless of amount of unsaved data to be previewed 
* When user follows links to navigate through the website from within the preview panel, the Page Selection dropdown menu now keeps up to date with the user's currently previewed page, and the browser will remember that location after a page reload 
* Adjusted width constraints on the preview panel in "Laptop" mode 
* Image upload widgets are now visually consistent across all major browsers when no image has yet been selected 

### Call Time Tracker###
