The following changes have been released today. 

### Website Builder### 
* "Permalinks" now work, meaning that e.g. if you visit the URL [/app/website/#contact](https://pies.pccc.co/app/website/#contact) you will be shown a preview of the Contact page instead of the site homepage 
* Fixed some garbled text in the explanatory modal window about your ActBlue donation link 
* The sidebar's dropdown menu for page navigation now contains a caret all the time, making it more clear that it is an interactive widget 

### Candidate Website### 
* The page heading on the Contact page is now just "Contact" instead of "Contact the Campaign" 
* Logos in the top left section are now allowed to be somewhat taller, which prevents the images from rendering in unusably small dimensions 

### Social Link Builder### 
* Checkboxes now appear next to Step 2's Facebook and Twitter options, making it more clear that they are interactive widgets and making their state changes more apparent
