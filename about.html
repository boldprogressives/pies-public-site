      	<p>Have you been wondering what’s the next evolutionary step of campaigning? The PCCC has. Over the past year, the team has been working quietly on just that.  
		</p>
		
		<p>A central part of our work at the PCCC is getting knowledge, in the form of best practices and training, into the hands of progressive campaigns.  Now, we’ve taken the next step - automating these best practices by turning them into easy to use tools.
		</p>
		
		<p>PIES was built to help you launch your campaign quickly and expertly, without wasting time or money. Whether it’s setting up a campaign website in minutes, or  tracking your fundraising efforts a snap, PIES will save your campaign time and money.
