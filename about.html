      	<p>Have you been wondering what’s the next evolutionary step of campaigning? The PCCC has. Over the past year, the team has been working quietly on just that.  
		</p>
		
		<p>A central part of our work at the PCCC is getting knowledge, in the form of best practices and training, into the hands of progressive campaigns.  Now, we’ve taken the next step - automating these best practices by turning them into easy to use tools.
		</p>
		
		<p>PIES was built to help you launch your campaign quickly and expertly, without wasting time or money. Whether it’s setting up a campaign website in minutes, or  tracking your fundraising efforts a snap, PIES will save your campaign time and money.
		</p>

		<h3>Use of Campaign Data</h3> 
 
		<p>When you use PIES tools and applications, you may be providing or maintaining in databases maintained in or through PIES, specific information about campaign donors, supporters, volunteers, potential donors, finances and personnel,. All of this information relating to specifically identifiable individuals is referred to a “Campaign Data.”
		</p>
		
		<p>PCCC will not disclose your Campaign Data to any other person or entity for any purpose whatsoever, other than an employee of or consultant to PCCC  for the purpose of maintaining, operating, modifying, and improving PIES.  In no event will PCCC disclose your Campaign Data to any other user of PIES . PCCC does reserves the right, however, to include your Campaign Data in aggregate data and analyses, and to disclose such aggregate data and analyses publicly or to such persons and organizations as PCCC deems appropriate. 
		</p>
		
		<p>PCCC also reserves the right to access your Campaign Data for the purpose of monitoring the progress, status and activities of your campaign, and for purposes of carrying out PCCC’s own programs and activities, including but not limiting to determining whether, when, and how PCCC may endorse a candidate and determining the allocation of PCCC’s resources to particular campaign; and for the purpose of modifying and improving PIES.
		</p>
		
		<p>In addition, PCCC reserves the right to disclose your Campaign Data to companies that assist us in maintaining PIES but only for purposes of providing services to PCCC with the strict requirement that any such company will never itself have the right to use your Campaign Data itself for any reason. PCCC also reserves the right to disclose or use your Campaign Data to comply with applicable law or legal requirements (for example, a lawful subpoena), to protect our rights or property, or to protect PCCC supporters from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful conduct.
 		</p>
 		
 		<p>Upon  termination of your access to PIES by PCCC for any reason, you may request a copy of your Campaign Data by sending an e-mail to ___________________.  PCCC will make reasonable efforts to provide to you as much of your Campaign Data as practicable.   PCCC may also retain its own copy of your Campaign Data for use and analysis by PCCC internally.
